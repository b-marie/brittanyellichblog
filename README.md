# Welcome

This is my main website using Hugo with the [LoveIt theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/loveit/).

I also have another repo, [brittanyellichprojects](https://github.com/brittanyellich/brittanyellichprojects), which is a react app for a few of the react items on my site.

## Local Development (reminders for when I actually make changes to this)

Install hugo with `brew install hugo`

Git Clone the Love It theme `git clone https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt`

Run the application locally with `hugo server -D`
