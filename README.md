# Welcome!

This is the first stab at moving my Ghost and Gatsby site over to a Hugo site using the [LoveIt theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/loveit/).

My plan is to have this site build to S3 and have brittanyellich.com point to this site to host future blog content. That maybe will have something more recent than 2019 in it (yet to be seen!)

I'm also planning to build a simple create-react-app to host existing projects (and maybe new projects, if that whole free time thing exists at some point) at projects.brittanyellich.com. Then, maybe learn enough about Go templating to create some simple static project content on brittanyellich.com to point towards the React app (that I actually do know how to build things in).
