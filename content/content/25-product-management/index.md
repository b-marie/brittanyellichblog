[Notes](../../notes) / [Product Management](./)

## Usability

* If something requires a large investment of time, it's less likely to be used.
* Usability attributes:
  * Useful: Does it do the thing that people need done?
  * Learnable: Can people figure out how to use it?
  * Memorable: Do they have to relearn it every time they use it?
  * Effective: Does it get the job done?
  * Efficient: Does it get the thing done quickly?
  * Desirable: Do people want it?
  * Delightful: Do people enjoy using it?
* Websites should be self-evident and obvious. People don't like to puzzle over how to do things.
* People don't read web pages. They scan them, and usually pick the first choice that looks like it will get us where we want to go. Your website should be optimized for that.
* Your website is a billboard people are passing by at 60 mph. It shouldn't have a ton of text or stuff for people to figure out.
