## Overview

I've attempted to get involved in dev twitter multiple times, as it seems like one of the best avenues for networking with other engineers that work remotely. Here are some tips and learning resources I've gathered along the way.

* The typical advice for getting started with Twitter is to follow some good people in your community and follow who they follow
* Chasing follower counts is not the best way to create genuine interactions
* Don't overuse hashtags. In fact, only use hashtags in very, very limited scenarios.
* Twitter is for connecting people in real life. Your goal should be to meet people that you'll then meet later at conferences, jobs, etc.
* Unfollow people that are spammy and noisy
* Use lists to categorize people by specific topics that they tweet about
* Stay 90% positive. Point out truly awesome things and elaborate on why they're great. Be a beacon of awesome.
* Avoid boring industry debates (no one cares about talking about deploying on fridays or whether dark mode or light mode is the best)
* Some ways to engage:
  * Answer questions when people need help
  * Offer insightful responses in discussions
  * Tag people to connect them (in moderation)
  * Ask good, thought-provoking questions
  * Offer code or design tips
  * Share great projects, blog posts, and videos
  * Summarize podcasts and talks
  * Make lists of your learnings
