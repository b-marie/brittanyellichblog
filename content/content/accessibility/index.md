## Overview

### Why is accessibility important?

* Good accessibility is good design. It allows anyone to experience what you've made regardless of what technology they use.
* Understanding the tools used to enhance accessibility on the web as well as how a user may be limited will improve the abilities of developers and designers to build more accessibile websites.

### HTML Elements for Better Accessibility

#### Layout

* HTML layout is one of the most important things to be aware of for screen readers. A screen reader will read the HTML of a website from top to bottom, using headings to differentiate sections of the content. If your website is not properly structured it will be far more difficult to navigate.
