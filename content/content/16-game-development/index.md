## Unity

* Unity is a great option because it's so universally used.
* An alternative to learning Unity instead of tutorials:
  * Step 1: Learn the absolute basics
  * Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the basics
  * Step 3: Over time add more advanced skills as you need to apply them
* GameObject: Everything in Unity is a GameObject
  * An invisible container with a position, rotation, and scale, which you can fill with components to make it do stuff
  * Sprite renderer to give it an image
  * Rigid Body to give it physics
  * A collider to make it hit things
  * A script to write programming code for it
* Ask yourself questions about those GameObjects, like "How do I make GameObjects spawn on the screen?" or "How do I make GameObjects run into each other", and then google from there
* Recreate a game on your own

## Game Design

### Prototyping

* Game Design is the most important part of building a game and should be the first thing you nail down when building a game
* The Gameplay is key. Make sure the game will be fun before you spend time making it.
* Build a prototype to see if an idea is fun or not. Usually unfinished art, or sprites stolen from other games, just to see if the game idea works
* It's common for new ideas to arise during prototyping
