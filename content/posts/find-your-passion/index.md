Today is day 2 of #blogvent, where I'm writing a blog post every day for the month of December. [Shoutout to @cassidoo for the idea](https://bsky.app/profile/cassidoo.co/post/3lcbjdiahas2l)!

It's the time of year where I'm reflecting on this past year, and identifying what changes I need to make to re-focus for 2025.

One of those changes is to focus on the things that I am most passionate about. As such, I've been researching the best ways to find your passion.

The tech industry is vast, with endless opportunities for innovation, problem-solving, and growth. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to pivot within the field, finding your true passion can be the key to a fulfilling career. But how do you discover what excites you in such a fast-paced and diverse space?

## How to Find Your Passion

I'm a serial generalist. Usually whatever I'm most passionate about is whatever is right in front of me. But, as I'm learning as I journey further into my career, at more senior levels you spend more time defining problems rather than just solving them. So, to exercise that muscle I decided that I needed to find what I'm most passionate about.

Here are some steps I have come across to help you uncover your passion in tech:

### 1. Explore Different Fields Within Tech

Tech is not just coding and programming—there are many niches to explore. From AI and cybersecurity to UX design, data science, and cloud computing, the variety of career paths can be overwhelming. Start by researching different areas and learning what each involves. Online courses, workshops, or attending tech meetups can give you a taste of different disciplines.

### 2. Identify What Excites You

Think about the moments when you feel energized or excited while working on a tech project. Is it solving complex problems? Building intuitive user interfaces? Or perhaps making a tangible impact through technology? Identifying the tasks or outcomes that bring you satisfaction can provide valuable insight into what drives you.

### 3. Get Hands-On Experience

Sometimes, the best way to discover your passion is through trial and error. Experiment with side projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, or even intern or volunteer in different roles. Hands-on experience will help you identify the types of work you enjoy most and provide clarity on where you want to specialize.

### 4. Follow Industry Trends and Communities

Tech is constantly evolving. Staying up-to-date with the latest trends, attending industry conferences, or following thought leaders on platforms like Bluesky or LinkedIn can inspire new interests. Engaging with communities—both online and in-person—can introduce you to new ideas and challenges, sparking a deeper connection to areas you hadn’t considered before.

### 5. Reflect on Your Strengths and Values

Your passion often aligns with your strengths. Are you a creative thinker who enjoys design? Do you have a knack for problem-solving and enjoy the logical nature of coding? Understanding your own skills and values will guide you toward areas in tech that align with who you are, not just what’s trending.

### 6. Be Open to Change

Your passion may evolve as you grow in your career. Stay open to new opportunities and don’t be afraid to pivot. Tech is all about adaptation and innovation, so embrace the idea that your interests may shift over time. The key is to stay curious and never stop learning.

## What I'm Most Passionate About

Here are the things I have come across that I have decided I'm most passionate about recently:

- Accessibility
- Building performant React frontends
- Building things using Golang
- Making existing applications better: more available, more scalable, more performant
- Doing excellent code reviews
- Mentoring other engineers
- Writing really good tests

## Final Thoughts

Finding your passion in the tech industry isn’t a one-size-fits-all journey. It requires exploration, experimentation, and reflection. But with persistence, you’ll discover a path that not only excites you but also propels you toward a meaningful and rewarding career.
