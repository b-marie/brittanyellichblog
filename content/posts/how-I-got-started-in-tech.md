When I first started transitioning to working in tech, I thrived off of these kinds of posts. Learning how people from a non-traditional background ended up with a successful career as an engineer was my bread and butter. Very often, the path to a career in technology is not very straight, and is filled with several pit stops along the way. I thought it may be good timing to share my own story of how I went from a completely different career to working as a software engineer.

While I like to think I'm still pretty young, it feels as though I've been working for a long time. I've been working since I was 14, and am approaching the threshold of having spent more time in my life with a job than without one. This has afforded me the opportunity to work a variety of different jobs. Often times, when I tell someone about my past work experience they're surprised. Not very many people can picture me working in clean rooms, or in an iron foundry, or even inspecting roofs.

I was young when I went to college and had to make the first big decision about what I wanted to do with my life. My naivety landed me on a pre-med track at Oregon State University, studying Biology, along with over 1,000 other freshmen in 2009. After an extremely rocky first term, fraught with far too much freedom and a little bit of swine flu, the overworked freshman adviser was all too happy to point me towards a different direction the moment I showed my first sign of pre-med doubt. While still completely unsure of how I was going to transform an education into an actual career, the adviser handed me off next door to chat with the freshman adviser in environmental science. I ended up changing my major that very day.
