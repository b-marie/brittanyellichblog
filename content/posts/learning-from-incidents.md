One of the best benefits of working for a large company is the talent that they are able to draw in for internal training days. I recently had the opportunity to participate in DevOps at Nike Day, and hear from many excellent speakers. One such speaker presented on chaos engineering and incident investigation in a way that prompted me to think hard about my career experience and how well set up I have become for taking part in the care and feeding of a healthy production system through chaos and post-mortems.

The world of software incident investigations is in a very early stage. Most people consider an incident to be something that a customer reports, or something that causes an outage in production. While those are both types of incidents, there are many other things that can impact a software system in a negative or unexpected way that provide ample opportunity for learning.

There's no point in reinventing the wheel, however. There is another subsection of industry that has been focused on investigating and learning from incidents that occur, and putting measure in place to make sure they don't happen again: Safety. This is a subsection that has been borrowed from in the past in tech (if you're familiar with the Incident Command System, that was adopted from safety). It also happens to be something that I am very familiar with, having had a background in safety prior to making the jump to technology.

## Background

There aren't many people I've met in tech that are interested in hearing about my career in safety. There is a lot, however, that anyone responsible for a production system can learn from the world of safety and risk management. Safety is a world away from tech, where the largest safety concerns are generally eye strain, carpal tunnel, or back pain from sitting all day.

In contrast, my time in safety was spent at manufacturing plants, construction sites, and farms. Places where if something goes wrong or someone isn't paying attention, you could get very seriously injured. Sometimes even to the tune of a fatality. We took safety very seriously.

I often think to myself how much further along I would be in my career if I had gone to school for computer science in the first place. If, when I graduated in 2013, I had completed an engineering degree instead of an environmental science degree. I would be nearly at 7 years of experience right now, far further along than my current year and a half. The reason I didn't pursue engineering in the first place is a completely different story of the bias I had unconsciously held regarding women in tech. Looking back on my Rocky career start now, however, I still wouldn't change the route that I took in any way.

I picked up some absolutely invaluable skills working in safety and risk control. It's a totally different world from the pristine, and frankly a bit spoiled, world of tech. I spent about a year working in safety directly at two different manufacturers, two years conducting research as a graduate student, and another two years working as a consultant in risk control, while trying to find my place in the world.

Working in safety was a bit like being on the show "How It's Made". You got to talk to everyone, from the brand new employee to the CEO, and learn about how their job was done. You had a free pass to go just about anywhere you wanted to. It's amazing how little most people know about the other jobs and the buildings they work in. Some people that have worked in the same building for 20 years never get to see the view from the roof.

Safety taught me the importance of attention to detail, how to communicate with almost anyone, and most importantly how to ask questions. A lot of questions. All the time. Because if you didn't ask those questions, or point out flaws in the plan for an upcoming change, someone could get very seriously hurt. In addition, safety was my first exposure to incident investigation.

Between safety jobs I decided to return to school, mostly because I really love to learn. The structure provided by school is incredible. It wasn't until after my Master of Public Health that I learned how to effectively teach myself, and so returning to school seemed like the best option.

Graduate school was my first exposure to working in tech. I worked with two professors as a research assistant, and took on several computer-related tasks. This included making updates and changes to a website used for health and safety training, building out eLearning modules for online training, and building a database of pollution measurements for use in GIS-based research. It was the first time I realized I could make money doing what I loved, working with computers.

It was also an awful lot of fun. I met some of my very best friends to this day in that program, and loved the opportunity to return to school and have my primary job be to learn. The classes were incredibly interesting, covering healthcare systems, toxicology, ergonomics, and how the environment has an impact on human health. Admittedly, quite a few things that I don't currently deal with day to day in my career. But it opened my eyes to how many public health issues can be solved through technology, and showed me a world where I might one day have a place.

It still took a long time for me to learn that I did have a place in tech. I never knew any female software engineers growing up. And despite having worked on building computers and making websites since I was 12 years old, I had this unconscious bias that women couldn't work in software.

After graduate school I spent a good majority of my free time outside of work building side projects, still not quite dedicated to pivoting my career. I also took a job as a risk management consultant working with Liberty Mutual Insurance.

Risk management was a different beast. I was no longer just looking at safety. It also included auto, or car accident risks, liability risks (how not to get sued) and property risks (how not to burn down or flood your building). Working in insurance and with commercial insurance customers taught me a lot about how businesses work and make decisions. It also forced me out of my comfort zone in many ways.

I had a list of customers I had to go visit and assess the various covered risks at, a territory that spanned from Central Oregon to Northern Utah, and a company car to make it happen. It was an insane amount of driving. My primary customers were farms, construction sites, and small-to-medium-sized manufacturers.

I quickly got over my millennial-sourced nerves of calling strangers on the phone. The customers occasionally had a heads up that I would be requesting some time with them to walk through their facility, but that wasn't always the case. There were a lot of relationships to manage.

Often times customers came into our meetings in a very combative state, nervous that I would be there to tell them what to do or to raise their insurance rates. And my job was not only to talk them down to leave a good perception of our company, but also to assess their operations and provide recommendations on how they could improve risks inherent to their business. All while working alone and being an early-20s woman meeting primarily with older, male business owners or construction foremen. I gotta say, the struggles associated with being a woman in tech, where most people I've had the pleasure of meeting are largely supportive and aware of the current issues, has been a refreshing change of pace compared to working in safety and risk management.
