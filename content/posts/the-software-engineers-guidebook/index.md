I loved this book, and a full summary and review of it is sure to come shortly. However I wanted to share some of the book club discussion questions for this book that we came up with for anyone else looking to organize a book club for this book.

## About Our Book Club

I'm in a book club at work that focuses on technical and career development books. Meeting with the folks in the book club regularly is lovely, but the real value of the book club is in keeping me accountable to do the reading and providing new perspectives on what we have read.
