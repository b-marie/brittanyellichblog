Once in a while, the universe aligns, and you stumble upon that perfect book at the perfect moment. For me, that cosmic timing happened in December 2023 when I dove into the pages of "Lean In."

Let me tell you, 2023 has been a rollercoaster ride. I welcomed twins into the world, which explains the recent radio silence on this website. Having babies in the latter half of the year conveniently turns it into the defining chapter of your life. In 2023, I became a parent of twins â€“ a neat and complete narrative.

Fast forward three months from the early arrival of my bundles of joy in August, and I've finally reclaimed more than three consecutive hours of sleep. Now, with the prospect of returning to work looming, I find myself navigating the uncharted waters of my new identity as a working mother of three. And guess what? "Lean In" couldn't have come into my life at a more opportune time.

Here are some takeaways from the book that resonated deeply with my current situation:

1. **Ambition Double Standards:** Men are expected to be ambitious, but when a woman is labeled as such, it's often not a compliment. Success for women can come at a social cost, creating an uphill battle where success and likability are inversely correlated.
2. **Gendered Socialization:** Right from birth, parents treat boys and girls differently. Mothers tend to underestimate their daughters' abilities, perpetuating the belief that girls need more assistance than boys.
3. **Media Myths about Working Moms:** Media perpetuates the narrative that women can't excel both in their careers and as mothers, painting a picture of impossible choices and inevitable stress. Positive portrayals of women balancing work and family are rare, and those who do are met with the baffling question, "I don't know how she does it."
4. **Top-Level Disparities:** Women are still vastly underrepresented in positions of power, impacting decision-making at high levels. The lack of women in influential roles is detrimental to making decisions that positively impact women's rights and equality.
5. **Mentorship Matters:** Finding the perfect mentor isn't a magical solution to climbing the corporate ladder. Instead, the focus should be on networking with senior leaders, seeking advice, and actively following up on the impact of that advice.

"Lean In" is not just a book; it's a manifesto for feminism, a guide to finding gender equality both at work and in life. As someone who takes pride in being both ambitious at work and a dedicated mother, this book felt like a beacon of wisdom. It shattered the stereotype of the frazzled working mom, proving that it's not an insurmountable struggle.

Personally, I can attest to the fact that being a dedicated mother and a committed employee is not only doable but enhances both roles. Having a partner who equally shares the responsibilities of parenting, just as emphasized in the book, is pivotal to this success.

Choosing workplaces that support the flexibility required for effective parenting has also been a game-changer for me. Shoutout to GitHub for providing competitive parental leave, giving me the time and space to connect with my new babies and reflect on my career.

As I wrap up this year, preparing for Christmas with my enthusiastic 3-year-old, I'm filled with the fresh energy of the approaching New Year. While my writing took a back seat this year, I'm optimistic that the new year will bring with it a renewed commitment to sharing more stories and insights. Cheers to the end of a transformative year and the promising adventures that await in the year to come!
