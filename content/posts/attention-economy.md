On any given day, I'm very plugged into my world, no matter where I am. For work I've always got Slack and email notifications in case anyone needs to reach me. I'm on Discord and Snapchat to keep up with my friends. And then when I want to learn what's going on in the world, Twitter and Reddit are only a swipe away. The act of pulling out my phone to entertain my brain during every spare minute I have has become such second nature that I often don't even notice that I'm doing it.
