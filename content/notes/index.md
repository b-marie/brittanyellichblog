# Notes

I decided in late 2022 that I wanted to put my learning process online. This is for a few reasons, but primarily because I thought it would motivate me to clean up my notes a bit if others may be reading them (hello, future me!).

This is the process that I've been following for a while to keep track of my learning. Call this a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), or a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). I maintain three lists, "Things I'm Learning", "Things I Want To Learn", and "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now".

For  "Things I'm Learning", this is what I build my quarterly development plan around. I like to set a few goals each quarter related to each item, to make sure that I'm making the progress that I want to make. This also usually fits in nicely with whatever development plan/OKR process that my current company has. I like to keep 5-6 items on this list, so that my learning goals don't get too overwhelming within a quarter.

For "Things I Want To Learn", this gives me the space to collect resources and write notes about something that I'm excited about learning at some point, but may not be a main focus for me currently. I may still peruse a resource I come across related to this topic and add a few notes, but I don't try to make a goal related to it. Each quarter I'll re-evaluate the items on the top two lists and decide if I should promote an item from "Things I Want To Learn" to "Things I'm Learning".

Finally, for "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now", I put items on that list to give myself the mental space to say no. This way I can check out from the books, articles, and twitter conversations related to those topics. It's so easy to get caught up in the hype and feel like you have to check out every piece of content about every new technology thrown your way. I acknowledge, though, that I don't have time for that, and my efforts would be better spent focusing on the things that I'm *really* excited about. (Note that I added "Right Now" to that list... I could always change my mind!!)

Every quarter I like to go through my own "quarterly planning" of sorts. I'll make a list of things that I want to accomplish related to each topic, break those down into smaller tasks (because I love checking boxes!), and evaluate how I did in the previous quarter. On the same page, I also like to start a [Brag Document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template) that I can use to track accomplishments, which makes it much easier come performance review time to write down all the things that I've done. Due to the sensitive nature of a lot of things in that document, I am not going to include that on my website, but you can get a template for one here if you'd like! In fact, if you like this process, feel free to check out these templates so that you can replicate the process yourself!
