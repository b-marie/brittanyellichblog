# Notes

I decided in late 2022 that I wanted to put my learning process online. This is for a few reasons, but primarily because I thought it would motivate me to clean up my notes a bit if others may be reading them (hello, future me!).

This is the process that I've been following for a while to keep track of my learning. I maintain three lists, "Things I'm Learning", "Things I Want To Learn", and "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now".

For  "Things I'm Learning", this is what I build my quarterly development plan around. I like to set a few goals each quarter related to each item, to make sure that I'm making the progress that I want to make. I like to keep 5-6 items on this list, so that my learning goals don't get too overwhelming within a quarter.

For "Things I Want To Learn", I know it's something I want to focus on in the future but I don't have time for it currently. I may still peruse a resource I come across related to this topic and add a few notes, but I don't try to make a goal related to it. Each quarter I'll re-evaluate the items and decide if I should move an item between lists.

Finally, for "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now", I put items on that list to give myself the mental space to say no. This way I can ignore the content related to those topics. It's easy to get caught up in the hype and feel like you have to pay attention to every piece of content thrown your way. I don't have time for that, and my efforts would be better spent focusing on the things that I'm excited about. (Note that I added "Right Now" to that list... I could always change my mind!!)

Every quarter I like to go through my own "quarterly planning". I'll make a list of things that I want to focus on related to each topic and break those down into smaller tasks. Then I check how I did at the end of the quarter. This way I'm always making progress on what's most important to me.
