# Notes

I maintain three lists, "Things I'm Learning", "Things I Want To Learn", and "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now".

* "Things I'm Learning": Quarterly development plan goals. I like to set a few goals each quarter related to each item, to make sure that I'm making the progress that I want to make. I like to keep a few items on this list, so that my learning goals don't get too overwhelming within a quarter.
* "Things I Want To Learn": Something I want to focus on in the future but I don't have time for it currently. I may still peruse a resource I come across related to this topic and add a few notes, but I don't try to make a goal related to it. Each quarter I'll re-evaluate the items and decide if I should move an item between lists.
* "Things I Don't Care To Learn Right Now": Things I've decided I don't care about at the moment. It's easy to get caught up in the hype and feel like you have to pay attention to every piece of content thrown your way. I don't have time for that, and my efforts would be better spent focusing on the things that I'm excited about. (Note that I added "Right Now" to that list... I will probably change my mind!!)
