# Notes

This collection of notes represents my public and more published body of knowledge and learning resources that I have accumulated throughout my career. 

## About

As I write my newsletter, [The Balanced Engineer Newsletter](https://balancedengineer.com), and as I continue to read and absorb information, I will periodically update the different categories and pages of notes listed on this site.

You can check out the list of blogs and newsletters that I follow in [this repo](https://github.com/brittanyellich/developers-who-blog). Otherwise, the majority of this knowledge has been gained and classified from a handful of books that are highly recommended in the tech industry or elsewhere.
